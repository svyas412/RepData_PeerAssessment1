Loading and preprocessing the data


```{r}
#set Working Directory
setwd ("C:/testR/labs-r/repres/data")
#Load Lilbraries as needed
library(dplyr)
library(datasets)

#Read activity.csv 
if(!exists("activity")){
  activity <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", 
                                                      "numeric"))
}
df<-data.frame(activity)
#Check the Activity data
head(activity)
names(activity)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
